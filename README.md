## Introduction

**RKRShell** is a _Formal Languages and Automata Theory_ class project which is basically a command-line interpreter that can be executed in both _Unix_ and _Windows_ operating systems.

A speech recognition module is also included in the project which makes it possible to control the interpreter just by saying its commands using your own voice.

_Flex & Bison_ are the major used resources within this project. _C/C++_ was the mostly used programming language to develop such a projetc.
